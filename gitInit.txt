git user guide:

-make git account on github.com

-install git on your machine (github has a good tut)

-make a simple txt file to commit and do it (using the git tuts)


-to add file:
	make file and save to a dir
	$ git add <filename>
	$ git commit -m 'MESSAGE HERE'
	$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git
	$ git push origin master
	
	if all goes well it will say something like: 
		Counting objects: 4, done.
		Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
		Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
		Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 440 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
		Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
		To https://github.com/bdew70/cs314
		   a085ceb..a937b40  master -> master
	
		if bad it will say "everything up to date"
